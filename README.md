# Titanic Data Analysis & Prediction ML Project 🛳️🤖

📌😊In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic using Python! 🐍✨

## Key Steps and Highlights 📊🔍

- **Dataset Exploration and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** 🔎  
  I began by analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the data structure, identify missing values, and detect potential outliers. The dataset contains essential information like passenger age, class, gender, and more.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** 🧹  
  I handled missing values using various techniques (mean, median imputation, etc.), encoded categorical variables, and scaled the numerical features. This was an essential step to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

- **Feature Engineering** ⚙️  
  Created new features based on existing data like family size, cabin type, and others to improve the model's performance. 🔧

- **Model Selection and Evaluation** 🎯  
  I used several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to train and test the model. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning** 🛠️  
  I tuned model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for improved prediction accuracy.

- **Insights and Visualizations** 📈  
  Visualized data distributions and model performance metrics using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide valuable insights. This helped in understanding feature importance and model behavior.

- **Final Model and Predictions** 📊  
  The model achieved a decent prediction accuracy, allowing us to predict the survival chances of passengers. I also provided a prediction function that can be used for future Titanic datasets.

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 🧑‍💻
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** 📊
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖

## What I Learned 🌱
- Understanding the importance of feature engineering in improving model performance.
- Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning.
- Learned how to evaluate and fine-tune models for optimal performance.
